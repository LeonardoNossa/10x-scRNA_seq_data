# Single-Cell Sequencing Analysis in R

## Description

This repository contains the code and scripts used for the analysis of single-cell sequencing data using **R**. Single-cell sequencing provides detailed insights into gene expression at the single-cell level, revealing cellular heterogeneity and potential subpopulations within complex biological samples.

The project's objective is to perform preprocessing, clustering, and differential expression analysis to identify key biological profiles.

## Repository Contents

The repository includes the following main components:

- **Preprocessing**: Data import, cell filtering, and normalization.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP to visualize the data structure.
- **Clustering**: Identification of cellular clusters using methods such as Louvain or K-means.
- **Differential Expression Analysis**: Comparison of gene expression levels between clusters.
- **Visualizations**: Heatmaps, violin plots, and dimensional reductions (UMAP, t-SNE) to explore and display results.

## Requirements

To run the project, you need to have **R** and the following packages installed:

- **Seurat** (for data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization)
- **dplyr** (for data manipulation)
- **ggplot2** (for graphical visualizations)
- **patchwork**

You can install the required packages with the following command:

```R
install.packages(c("Seurat", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "Matrix", "cowplot", "patchwork"))
```
